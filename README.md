# csctl

`csctl` is a command line interface for Containership Cloud.

This repository also contains the go client for interacting with Containership Cloud.
For more info, please refer to [the client documentation](cloud/README.md)

**Warning**: This project is currently under active development and is subject to breaking changes without notice.

## Installing

Currently the only way to install `csctl` is through go:

```
go get -u github.com/containership/csctl
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install via `make`:

```
make install
```

More installation methods will be added in the future as the project matures.
There are no official releases yet.

## Usage

Please use `csctl -h` for now to discover usage.

More documentation will be added as the project matures.

### Configuration

`csctl` defaults to a config file located at `~/.csctl.yaml`.
You may also choose to manually specify a config file using `--config`.

The only config option to set today is `token`.
Because the CLI does not yet support authorization, you must manually specify a `token`.
Your user token can be obtained by using the developer tools of your favorite browser to find the `JWT` for an API request.
Authorization is coming soon, but feel free to reach out with any questions in the meantime.
